# What is this application for ?

This application helps to quickly create smaller images from large image dataset.
As a result it creates json file which can be further processed. There is python script provided in project repository.


# How to use it ?

Go to File > Open  (cmd+O) and select directory with images you want to label.

For each image in that directory select the frames of your interest.  
To add new frame double click outside existing frame, to remove frame double click on existing frame.

If there is nothing to label click - remove to get rid of the file.

Save on json is done every time you click next or previous. Colour of the selection indicates if it's been picked already or no. If you reopen project and json file is there it will show all previously created frames.

Once you got all images labeled you can use scrip to create smaller images from the frames you selected.

If you want to label different category, rename or move json file and start again.
